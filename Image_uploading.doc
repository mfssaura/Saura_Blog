Now, we want to enable image upload for our posts which allow images to be uploaded when new posts are created. We will now make use of a gem called carrierwave. 

//Add the following gem in gemfile

gem 'carrierwave'
gem 'mini_magick'

Carrierwave helps us to enable seamless upload of images in your Rails application.
Mini_Magick helps in the processing of images.

> bundle install

Next run the generator file to ensure that some important files are generated such that CarrierWave works with Imagemagick
